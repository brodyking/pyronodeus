    <p>So what is up guys? I have been wanting to make new games recently. I really encourage you guys to go to the <a href="questions.html">q/a page</a> and give suggestions.</p>
    <p>I got some people asking why I added the fourm back to this revamped version of the website. And the reason is that is I plan to repoen the forums some time in the future. Dont quote me on that as I may not reopen them but if I have time I might. I just dont have the right software rn. The old forum software is still buggy and needs to be fixed.</p>
    <p>Anyways that is all I want to talk about today. The updates might start getting more dry as the days go on. I am going to be at school and stuff so writing a update and making new posts is going to be more hard to do.</p>
    <p>Oh, before I forget. I want to put a archive of the old site on this one. So all you have to do it go to somthing like <code>/classic/</code> and you will be at the old website. I dont know, just a thought. Alright bye!</p>
