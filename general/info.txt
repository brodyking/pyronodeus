This document will talk about creating your post and how to do it right along with talking about the rules.

Naming
====
If you want to get a custom name on the forum you have to ask for one in the q/a page. You can find a link to that page on the homescreen.
Everyones name is 'Anonymous'. This forum sometimes sruggles to get users. And I dont know about you, but when I am forced to make an account on a random forum, I usualy just dont bother.
    I dont want people to have to make an account. If you feel the need too, you can. But other than that, you and your IP address is the only identifable information attached to your. 
    
Rules
====
Please follow these rules carefuly if you want to not get perm banned on here...

    1. Dont spam
        Spamming will get you a good ban. 
    
    2. Dont impersonate mods
        Yeah, this is obvious. If you do, perm ban. I dont care who u are, BAN!
        
    3. Dont post links to off site things.
        If you do, I will just remove the post. No ban or anything. Maybe a mute if it becomes too frequent.

Privacy
====
Every time you post, you give up your rights to the privacy of you IP address. This is only because, if you use the website without an account, we need a way to ban you.
    Without a way to ban people who break the rules, there would be no point in trying to enforce them.
    
If you have an account, you IP address with not be logged. Now note, you IP address is only logged for the first 5 days. After that the script I wrote will delete your IP from our file.
    Meaning that your post would not be attached to your IP address.
    
If you want to use a VPN such as NordVPN, Windscribe, Tunnelbear, etc, then you can. I myself, always use a vpn even when I am not torrenting stuff.

Final Notes
====
This is really all of the information you have to read to be able to post on here. Anyways have fun on the fourms!
