        <p>As you know, I used to use <strong>wick editor</strong> which is basicaly just fake adobe flash. But recently I found a new engine to use!</p>
        <img src="screenshots/ss11.png" style="border-radius:10px">
        <p>Now I will most likly end up not using it because I have 0 patience when learning new things but oh well. Anyways it is called <strong>GB Studio</strong> and it lets you create games from the gameboy. But you can also compile them to be .exe's and .html files. So that kinda interests me.</p>
        <p>There are 2 main issues right now with wick.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The loading times are too long</li>
            <li>There are camera issues</li>
            <li>Javascript sucks ass</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now using gbstudio would eliminate most of these issues but create new ones too.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Compiling takes forever</li>
            <li>You have to make the assets outside of the engine</li>
            <li>You have to use apache for viewing inside of the browser</li>
            <li><strong>Game controls are weird</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now most of these issues are fine. I dont care about most of them. In fact, most of these just affect me. But there is one that I worry about. Because this is meant for making gameboy games, it has weird controls. Jump is CTRL, Bringing up menus and dialongs is SHIFT. Like it is just strange.</p>
        <p>Again I am still in the questioning phase right now but I might make the switch. Tell me about what you think in the <a href="forum.php.html">forums</a>. Anyways I'll see you all later!</p>
