        <p>Today I started my first day of (trying) to use unreal engine. And it is harder than I thought.</p>
        <p>The only thing I was able to make was a simple 3rd person game with a couple of boxes just floating around. I would upload the game to my website but a zip alone is around 1/2 a gig. I only pay for 20gb hosting so I am not risking spending all of my storage space on that.</p>
        <img src="screenshots/ss13.png" style="border-radius:10px">
        <p>Alright I am going to talk about what I figured out how to do here.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a new project.</li>
            <li>Navagate the <strong>trash</strong> layout.</li>
            <li>Make custom materials.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now I am just about as confused as a kid going to a school who doesn't know the language and is also 5 years younger than everyone else. But that is okay. I will get the hang of it soon (I hope).</p>
        <h3>Other peoples games</h3>
        <p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198966019496">Jaansand2236</a> is going to be putting his new game on the website. I will be putting credit to him when it comes out too. He is gonna make a recreation of the game <a href="https://www.y8.com/games/slope">slope</a>. I will post updates on the forums btw.</p>
        <p>Alright thats all I want to let you guys know. Aight bye.</p>
